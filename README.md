# Status
Work in progress. Layout and structure pretty much complete, however still misses some things from the lecture.

# Disclaimer
Please be advised that nothing found here is guaranteed to be complete, correct or anything else. Feel free to report errors, I'll try to fix them.

# Note
This is largely based on the great work by ![Gregor Wegberg's](https://github.com/groggi) ![CIL Exam 2015 Summary](https://github.com/groggi/eth-cil-exam-summary).
It has simply been adapted to the new lecture content of 2016.
